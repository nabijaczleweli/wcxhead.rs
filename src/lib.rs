//! # Unicode Support
//!
//! With Total Commander 7.5 (packer plugin interface 2.20), Unicode support has been added to all plugin types. In principle,
//! you need to implement the same functions as for ANSI, with two differences: The function name is changed from FunctionName
//! to FunctionNameW, and Ansi strings are changed to wide char names.
//!
//! Total Commander will call the Unicode functions on all NT-based systems (Windows NT, 2000, XP) if they are present. If not,
//! or on Windows 9x/ME, Total Commander will call the Ansi functions.
//!
//! The following functions of the packer plugin interface support Unicode:
//!
//! OpenArchiveW<br />
//! ReadHeaderExW<br />
//! ProcessFileW<br />
//! SetChangeVolProcW<br />
//! SetProcessDataProcW<br />
//! PackFilesW<br />
//! DeleteFilesW<br />
//! StartMemPackW<br />
//! CanYouHandleThisFileW<br />
//!
//! The following functions do not exist in a Unicode form and must be implemented as Ansi:
//!
//! ReadHeader - use ReadHeaderEx<br />
//! CloseArchive<br />
//! GetPackerCaps<br />
//! ConfigurePacker<br />
//! PackToMem<br />
//! DoneMemPack<br />
//! PackSetDefaultParams<br />
//! ReadHeaderEx
//!
//! What's the easiest way to support Unicode in an existing plugin?
//!
//! 1. Get my sample plugin fsplugin (file system plugins section) even if you write a different type of plugin!
//! 2. Add the files cunicode.h and cunicode.cpp to your project. They contain various functions to make Unicode support easier.
//! 3. Convert your existing functions to Unicode and rename them to FunctionNameW.
//!    For all file functions like CreateFile, do not call their Unicode counterpart CreateFileW directly.
//!    Instead, call the functions from cunicode.cpp like CreateFileT.
//!    These functions automatically call the right Unicode or Ansi function,
//!    and even support file name lengths >259 characters!
//!
//! 4. For each converted function like FunctionNameW, recreate a function FunctionName which you call this way:
//!
//! ```c
//! int __stdcall FunctionName(char* SomeString1,char* SomeString2)
//! {
//!     WCHAR SomeString1W[wdirtypemax],SomeString2W[wdirtypemax];
//!     return FunctionNameW(awfilenamecopy(SomeString1W,SomeString1),awfilenamecopy(SomeString2W,SomeString2));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The Macro awfilenamecopy will convert the Ansi string SomeString1 to Unicode and store it inSomeString1W. This variable
//! must not be a pointer, because awfilenamecopy uses "countof" to get the target length.
//!
//! # 64-bit support
//!
//! With Total Commander 8, Total Commander is now also available in 64-bit. Since plugins are simple dlls, and 64-bit programs
//! can only load 64-bit dlls, a plugin needs to be re-compiled with a 64-bit compiler to work with 64-bit Total Commander.
//!
//! **IMPORTANT**: A 64-bit plugin must have the same name as the 32-bit plugin and be in the same directory, but '64' must be
//! appended to the extension. Example: filesystem.wcx -> filesystem.wcx64. 64-bit-only plugins must also end with '64'.
//!
//! Since all 64-bit Windows versions support Unicode, it's sufficient to write a 64-bit Unicode-only plugin. However, if your
//! existing 32-bit plugin only supports ANSI functions, you can port it without modifications to 64 bit. Total Commander
//! 64-bit also supports the ANSI functions if it cannot find the Unicode functions. 64-bit Unicode plugins do not have an
//! extension starting with 'u', they have the normal 'wcx64' extension.
//!
//! ### Some porting notes:
//!
//! All integer parameters in plugin functions remain 32-bit (e.g. in C: int, long, DWORD; Delphi: integer, dword), only
//! pointers and handles are 64-bit wide now. Recompiling a program or dll with a 64-bit compiler usually takes care of this
//! automatically without needing many changes. Problems can arise when converting pointers to integer or vice versa. Make sure
//! to use 64-bit integer variables (e.g. size_t in C, ptrint or ptruint in Lazarus) for such operations.
//!
//! ### What's the easiest way to convert an existing plugin to 64-bit?
//!
//! #### 1. If the plugin was written in C or C++:
//!
//! If you have Visual Studio Professional 2005 or later, a 64-bit compiler is already included. If you use the free Express
//! version or Visual Studio 2003, you need to install the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) in addition to Visual Studio
//! Express.
//!
//! Here is how to add 64-bit support to an existing plugin:
//! 1. Check the toolbars in Visual Studio: There are comboboxes for the compile type (Debug or Release), and one which shows
//! "Win32".
//!
//! 2. Open the one showing "Win32", and click on the "Configuration manager".
//! 3. Click on "New" in the Active Solution Platform list (right side). A new dialog box "New Solution Platform" will be shown.
//! 4. In the upper field, choose "x64"
//! 5. In the lower field, "copy from", choose "Win32"
//! 6. Make sure the checkbox "Create new project platform" is on
//! 7. Click OK<br />
//! See also: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9yb4317s.aspx
//! 8. Now you can switch in the same project between Win32 and x64. Switch to x64.
//! 9. Open the settings of your project.
//! 10. You should set the following options:<br />
//!     C++ - Code generation - runtime library: Multi-threaded-Debug (/Mtd) <- not multithreaded debug dll !<br />
//!     Linker - General - output file: wcx/pluginname.wcx64
//!
//! ##### Download links:
//! 1. Visual Studio Express C++ edition:<br />
//! http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express
//! 2. Windows Software Development Kit (SDK):<br />
//! http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx
//!
//! #### 2. If the plugin was written in Delphi or Free Pascal:
//!
//! There is a 64-bit Lazarus/Free Pascal available, which can be used to create 64-bit dlls. Total Commander itself was
//! compiled with Lazarus as a 64-bit application. There are menu items in the "Tools" menu to convert Delphi projects and
//! forms to Lazarus.
//!
//! Lazarus/Free Pascal works a bit differently from Delphi, so some functions may need to be changed. Here are the problems
//! encountered when porting Total Commander:
//!
//! 1. Free pascal is different -> Use {$MODE Delphi} in all *.pas files to handle functions the Delphi way
//! 2. strnew creates a NIL pointer when the passed pchar is 0 bytes long. -> Use your own strnew function.
//! 3. Windows messages below WM_USER are not passed to the windows procedure. -> Use SetWindowLongPtr to subclass the window
//! 4. The calculation  p-buffer  is not working when p is a pwidechar, buffer an array of widechar -> use p-pwidechar(@bufffer)
//! 5. INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE is incorrectly set to 0 instead of -1 in lcltype.pp! -> Put "windows" at end of "uses" command.
//!
//! ##### Download links:
//! You should download and install the 64-bit daily snapshot from<br />
//! http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/<br />
//! Click on "Daily snapshots", then on e.g. Lazarus + fpc 2.4.4     **win64**<br />
//! The final releases are very outdated, so the snapshots usually work much better.
//!

/// tChangeValueProc is a typedef of the function that asks the user to change volume.

/// ```c
/// typedef int (__stdcall *tChangeVolProc)(char *ArcName, int Mode);
/// ```
///
/// # Description
///
/// `SetChangeVolProc` has provided you with a pointer to a function with this declaration. When you want the user to be asked
/// about changing volume, call this function with appropriate parameters. The function itself is part of Totalcmd - you only
/// specify the question. Totalcmd then asks the user, and you get the answer as the result of the call to this function. If
/// the user has aborted the operation, the function returns zero.
///
/// `ArcName` specifies the filename of the archive that you are processing, and will receive the name of the next volume.
///
/// Set `Mode` to one of the following values, according to what you want Totalcmd to ask the user:
///
/// | Constant      | Value | Description                                  |
/// | --------      | ----- | -----------                                  |
/// | PK_VOL_ASK    | 0     | Ask user for location of next volume         |
/// | PK_VOL_NOTIFY | 1     | Notify app that next volume will be unpacked |
///
/// Note
///

///
/// `SetProcessDataProc` has provided you with a pointer to a function with this declaration. When you want to notify the user
/// about the progress when un/packing files, call this function with appropriate parameters. The function itself is part of
/// Totalcmd - you only specify what Totalcmd should display. In addition, Totalcmd displays the Cancel button that allows the
/// user to abort the un/packing process. If the user has clicked on Cancel, the function returns zero.
///
/// `FileName` can be used to pass a pointer to the currently processed filename (0 terminated string), or NULL if it is not
/// available.
///
/// Set `Size` to the number of bytes processed since the previous call to the function. For plugins which unpack in
/// CloseArchive: Set size to negative percent value (-1..-100) to directly set first percent bar, -1000..-1100 for second
/// percent bar (-1000=0%).
